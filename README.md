 # 📊 Sales Performance Dashboard

This repository contains the files and code used to create a comprehensive **Sales Performance Dashboard** using Python, Pandas, and Power BI. The goal of this project was to analyze sales trends, measure key performance indicators (KPIs), and provide actionable business insights.

* **Data Cleaning:** Used **Pandas** in Python to clean and preprocess raw sales data (handling missing values, data type conversions, etc.).
* **KPI Tracking:** Calculated key metrics such as Total Revenue, Profit Margin, Sales Volume, and regional performance.
* **Trend Analysis:** Visualized monthly and quarterly sales trends to identify seasonality and growth patterns.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** The final dashboard was developed in **Power BI** for dynamic filtering and exploration of data by region, product, and time period.
